# Crypto Clustering
This project uses the k-means clustering algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction to group several cryptocurrencies based on price changes in each currency's value over different time scales.

## K-means clustering of scaled data.

The data is first assembled into a Dataframe and the numerical data is scaled using StandardScalar.  Then, an elbow curve is generated with the scaled data to determine the optimal number of groupings for the data.

Analysis continues using 4 groups.  A k-means model with 4 components is trained on the currency data and clusters are assigned to each row.  Below we see the results of this first clustering.

## K-means clustering with PCA dimensionality reduction.

The scaled data from the first step is reduced to 3 features using a PCA algorithm.  The above steps were repeated, generating a new elbow curve and a new scatter plot, again using 4 groupings.

## Conclusions

Upon visualizing the groupings, we see that in both cases we see two largely distinct groups as well as two noticeable outliers.  The outliers are the same between the two data sets: "ethlend" and "celsius-degree-token".  Visually, it is difficult to compare the two groupings, as there are dimensions of each plot which are not shown in the diagrams.  Nonetheless, we do see distinct groupings with some questionably grouped points on the boundaries, with neither group appearing to be obviously more valid than the other.  It is possible that the outliers in the data may be affecting the grouping algorithm, and future analysis may consider removing these points.  Additionally, silhouette analysis of the k-means clusterings may help in assessing which of the two groupings is better clustered around the centroids.
